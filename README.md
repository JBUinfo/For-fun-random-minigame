# (Twitch) Random Pokemon Battles
I created this minigame in 29 hours during several [twitch streamings](https://www.twitch.tv/jebx_).
I want to update and improve the code with my followers and see how much the code can change.

On the other hand, i want to apply things i have never used (testing, typescript in node, Vite...).
Here is my TODO list:

    - Apply the rules described here: https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-react/
    - Clean code
    - Indent code (With Prettier VScode extension)
    - Write comments
    - Use typescript in react and node
    - Make use of env.* files
    - Change styles.css to modules.css
    - Compile some states in Contexts
    - React.Portals?
    - Apply testing (Cypress, Jest, native NodeJS...)
        -Unit tests
        -Integration tests
        -End to end
