# (Twitch) Random Pokemon Battles
I created this minigame in 29 hours during several [twitch streamings](https://www.twitch.tv/jebx_).
I want to update and improve the code with my followers and see how much the code can change.

On the other hand, i want to apply things i have never used (NestJS, Vite, css-modules, testing, Cypress, Jest...).
Here is my TODO list:

    Done - 2.0 - Indent code (With Prettier VScode extension)
    Done - 2.0 - Change styles.css to modules.css
    - Apply the rules described here: https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-react/
    - Optimize react renders: https://blog.axlight.com/posts/4-options-to-prevent-extra-rerenders-with-react-context/
    - Clean code
    - Write comments
    - Use typescript in react and node
    - Make use of env.* files
    - Compile some states in Contexts
    - React.Portals?
    - Apply testing (Cypress, Jest, native NodeJS...)
        -Unit tests
        -Integration tests
        -End to end
