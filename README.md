# (Twitch) Random Pokemon Battles
I created this minigame in 29 hours during several [twitch streamings](https://www.twitch.tv/jebx_).
I want to update and improve the code with my followers and see how much the code can change.

On the other hand, i want to apply things i have never used (NestJS, Vite, css-modules, testing, Cypress, Jest...).
